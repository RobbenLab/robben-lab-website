I graduated from Nanjing Agricultural University and later obtained my master’s degree from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). In the fall of 2024, I began my PhD in Dr. Michael Robben’s laboratory, focusing on bioinformatics. I have background in bioinformatics and wet bench experiments, and my research primarily involves analyzing complex biological data, particularly in microbiome studies and understanding interactions between microorganisms and host health. I’m also passionate about applying machine learning techniques to biological research, with the goal of uncovering insights that can contribute to medical advancements and public health improvements.
