title: I-LAMB #The Animal Computational Cancer Immunology Lab
subtitle: The Illinois Laboratory for Animal Machine-learning and Bioinformatics
description: The goal of the Robben lab is to develop the next generation of multi-omic sequencing technologies to investigate immune cell dysfunction in cancer and autoimmune disease. The future of high-throughput sequencing combines transcriptomics, proteomics, genomics and imaging into techniques like single cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics. For the analysis of this data we need new computational methods utilizing machine learning algorithms that can identify patterns of cell interactions and differentiation.
