We are excited to welcome Lufan Yang and Jingwei (Julie) Xing to our lab as new Ph.D. students. Lufan joins us from Vet Med where he did a masters under Ying Fang studying swine viral disease. Julie pursued a masters in medicine at Fudan University in Shanghai where she studied dietary effects on postpartum stress in mouse models.
