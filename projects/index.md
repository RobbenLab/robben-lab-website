  title="Dysregulation of T-cells in inflammatory diabetes in NOD mice"
  text=text

{% capture text %}

scRNA-seq analysis of T-cells extracted from diabetic NOD mice revealed interesting indicators of T-cell dysregulation associated with development of the disease. This included suppression of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells on infiltration into the pancreas associated with specific TCR clones, and the remarkeable increased rate of Double Negative (DN) T-cells among circulating and infiltrating T lymphocytes. The objective or our research is two fold 1. Develop molecular and computational tools to identify epitopes for suppressed and unsuppressed cytotoxic T-cells and 2. Determine the mechanism of action for the development of circulating DN T-cells and their effect on disease progression.
