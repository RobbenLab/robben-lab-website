The I-LAMB lab at Illinois is focused on interdisciplinary research which means we are looking for researchers and students who have experience in Molecular/Cell biology, Bioinformatics, or Computational Biology/Computer Science and want to recieve comprehensive training in one or more of the other fields. Interested researchers with education/research experience in a different field are welcomed as well as we believe that new perspectives can add to our research program in interesting ways. New graduate students or undergraduate students with little or no research experience are also encouraged to reach out as long as they have the motivation to learn and conduct interdisciplinary research.
